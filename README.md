# PyTorch version of my Deep Learning class

The original version written in collaboration with Charles Ollion with the tensorflow / Keras library
is still available at:

https://m2dsupsdlclass.github.io/lectures-labs/

Compared to the original repo, this repo has:

- a subset of the slides and notebooks, slightly updated to use PyTorch
- a new notebook about GPT models.

Contrary to the original repo, all the notebooks should download their data
files from online locations instead of expecting files in the same folder.
Similarly the solutions to the exercises are now included inline. This should
make it easier to use GPU-enabled notebook services such as Google Colab or
Kaggle Notebooks.
